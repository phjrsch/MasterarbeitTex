	abstract = {Heat treatment processes are usually employed to control the mechanical properties of steels and quenching is one of the most common treatments. This article deals with the modeling and simulation of quenching in steel cylinders using a multi-phase constitutive model. Finite element method is employed for spatial discretization. Numerical simulations are carried out by considering an iterative process associated with the operator split technique. Initially, a veriﬁcation procedure is of concern establishing a comparison between numerical and experimental data, presenting a good agreement. Afterward, notched steel cylinders are treated evaluating the inﬂuence of notches in quenched pieces. Temperature, phase transformations and stresses are monitored during the quenching in order to give a general idea of the thermomechanical behavior of the process.},

	abstract = {The internal stresses generated during quenching can produce warping and even cracking of a steel body and, therefore, the prediction of such stresses is an important task. Phenomenological aspects of quenching involve couplings between different physical processes occurring in the phenomena. The present contribution is concerned with modelling and simulation of quenching, presenting an anisothermal model formulated within the framework of continuum mechanics and the thermodynamics of irreversible processes. A numerical procedure is developed based on an operator split technique associated with an iterative numerical scheme in order to deal with non-linearities in the formulation. With this assumption, the coupled governing equations are solved involving four uncoupled problems: thermal, phase transformation, thermoelastic and elastoplastic behaviours. The proposed general formulation is applied to analyse progressive induction hardening of steel cylinders. Numerical results suggest that the proposed model is capable of capturing the main behaviour observed in experimental data.},

	abstract = {Quenching is a commonly used heat treatment process employed to control the mechanical properties of steels. In brief, quenching consists of raising the steel temperature above a certain critical value, called austenitizing temperature, and then rapidly cooling it in a suitable medium to room temperature. The resulting microstructures formed from quenching (ferrite, cementite, pearlite, upper bainite, lower bainite and martensite) depend on cooling rate and on steel characteristics. This article deals with the themomechanical analysis of steel cylinder quenching. A multi-phase constitutive model is employed for its modeling and simulation. Experimental analysis related to temperature evolution during the process and its resulting microstructure is used as a reference for the modeling effort. The thermomechanical coupling terms of the energy equation are included in the formulation. The through hardening of a cylindrical body is considered as an application of the proposed general formulation. Numerical simulations present good agreements with experimental data, indicating the model capability to capture the general thermomechanical behavior of the quenching process.},

The energy equation thermo-mechanical coupling terms due to internal and thermal couplings are exploited. In order to analyze the importance of these terms, three diﬀerent models are considered. The ﬁrst one is an uncoupled model in the sense that these terms are neglected, corresponding to the rigid body energy equation. In second model, these couplings are represented through the incorporation of a source term in the energy equation associated with the latent heat released during the austenite–martensite phase transformation. Finally, the third model considers all thermo-mechanical coupling terms of the proposed model. Progressive induction hardening of a long cylindrical body is considered as an application of the proposed general formulation.

To demonstrate the applicability of the model, experiments have been performed on the DIN 34 Cr 4 steel. Investigations based on computer simulation veri®ed that the coupled multi-phase model can be applicable to predicting the CCT diagrams of low-alloy steels and calculating the microstructure and hardness distribution after quenching.

	abstract = {Die Komplexität des Schweißprozesses und das Verhalten der Werkstoffe infolge des Energieeintrages erfordern eine umfassende Betrachtungsweise. Die Entwicklung von numerischen Modellen und Methoden in den letzten 50 Jahren ermöglicht die Simulation, Analyse und Optimierung von Schweißverbindungen hinsichtlich Temperatur, Gefügestruktur und Eigenspannungen. Eine Differenzierung der Schweißsimulation in Prozess-, Werkstoff- und Struktursimulation gestattet eine gezielte Untersuchung von einzelnen Aspekten. Diese Unterteilung erfordert zum Teil eine starke Abstraktion und Idealisierung der Realität durch geeignete Annahmen und Randbedingungen, die von der zu untersuchenden Fragestellung abhängen. Dadurch wird eine Kalibrierung und Verifikation der Modelle mit Versuchsergebnissen notwendig. Die in dieser Arbeit durchgeführten Untersuchungen beschäftigen sich mit wichtigen Fragestellungen hinsichtlich der numerischen Simulation und experimentellen Untersuchung des Temperaturfeldes sowie des Gefüge- und Eigenspannungszustandes von MAG-Schweißverfahren an den Werkstoffen Feinkornbaustahl und Duplex-Stahl, CO2-Laserstrahlschweißverfahren am Werkstoff Quarzglas, Trennprozessen von Proben, WIG-Nachbehandlungsverfahren. Hinsichtlich der Naht- und Stoßarten orientierte sich die Arbeit an baupraktisch relevanten Schweißverbindungen sowie Besonderheiten, die sich aus Schweißprozessen und unterschiedlichen Werkstoffen ergeben. Eine Interpretation der numerisch und experimentell ermittelten Ergebnisse ermöglicht die Ableitung von allgemeingültigen Erkenntnissen zur Ausbildung des Temperaturfeldes, Entstehung von Gefügestrukturen und Eigenspannungen. Voraussetzungen für eine realitätsnahe Schweißsimulation zur Bestimmung von Temperatur, Gefügeanteil und Eigenspannung sind neben den Geometriemodellen geeignete numerische Modelle für die Einkopplung der Energie aus dem Schweißprozess und für die Abgabe der Energie durch Konvektion und Strahlung an die Umgebung, zur Beschreibung des thermischen und mechanischen Werkstoffverhaltens im Bereich von Raumtemperatur bis zur Schmelztemperatur.},

This model is coupled to the calculation of temperature, stress and strain evolutions in a massive specimen submitted to chemical composition gradients (here carbon gradients). The consequences of the stress-phase transformation interactions on the microstructure and stress evolutions during cooling are analysed in the specific case of gaz quenching of a case hardened specimen. It is shown that the internal stresses can have a large effect on the bainitic transformation kinetics and on the stress evolutions during cooling but the effect on the residual stress state remains relatively small.},

It is first described in the case of two phases and a unique transformation, then extended to the case of n phases and several (possibly simultaneous and unsymmetrical) transformations. The effect of austenite grain sixe can also be inchrti, an evolution equation for austenite grain sixe is then needed. We show that the classical equation is limited to the case of constant au\&mite proportion, and propose a reasonable extension of this classical equation to the general case.},

The scheme has been found to predict to within -+3 Re increments the hardness contours for a Jominy test and a Grossman test. Transformation kinetics applied to the TTT diagram suggests that while site saturation in the first 1\% of transformation is n o t strictly observed, 42\% o f the nodules are nucleated in this portion of the transformation and subsequently account for the majority of the transformation. Extension of the range of application of the method to noneutectoid steels appears promising when the transformation can be assumed to proceed in a continuous manner. It has been suggested that discontinuous transformations may also be treated with a slight modification of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Using a new approach to modeling bainite nucleation, the kinetics of isothermal bainite formation have been calculated under the assumption of displacive growth. The nucleation rate is assumed to depend on the number density of potential nucleation sites
              N
              i
              , a factor λ accounting for autocatalytic nucleation, and an activation energy Q*. Compatible with the theory for athermal martensite nucleation,
              N
              i
              is assumed to be proportional to the driving pressure. Analogous to the Koistinen – Marburger model for martensite formation, the average volume of bainitic sub-units is assumed to be constant over the extent of the transformation and the growth of sub-units is very fast, and thus the change in fraction is directly related to the nucleation rate of bainite. The model results in an analytical expression for the fraction bainite as a function of time that contains only two adjustable parameters: a (temperature independent) autocatalytic parameter λ and a rate parameter κ, which has a temperature dependence that is mainly governed by Q*. The calculations are compared with experimental fraction curves measured isothermally with dilatometry for the carbon steels C45, C50 and C60 at a range of temperatures. From the best agreement between the calculations and the experimental data it follows that Q* decreases linearly with temperature, which is consistent with other bainite nucleation models. By austenitizing steel C60 at different temperatures it is found that λ depends on the austenite grain size: when the austenite grain size is increased, λ becomes larger.},

As the most important surface modification technique, the heat treatment process is utilized in this work to promote the desired compressive residual stress on the near-surface of the 100Cr6 steel assembled cam. The Johnson-Mehl-Avrami equation and Koistinen-Marbuger law are integrated into the ABAQUS software via user subroutines to simulate the evolution of diffusional transformation and diffusionless transformation, respectively. The linear mixture law is used for describing the coupled thermomechanical and metallurgical behaviors in the quenching of steel cam. The influences of various quenchants and the probable maximum phase volume fractions on surface residual stress or hardness are analyzed. Results show that a greater amount of martensite volume fraction and a slower martensitic transformation rate are beneficial for the compressive stress retention. Compared with the conventional quenching oil, the fast oil quenched cam surface has higher final compressive stress and hardness.},

	abstract = {This study focuses on ﬁnite element investigations of quenching process which is commonly applied to improve mechanical properties such as strength, hardness, and wear/fatigue resistances, etc. During the quenching process, various kinds of microstructures evolve depending on the cooling rate and temperature variation within the steel. This microstructural evolution has a signiﬁcant effect on the ﬁnal dimension and geometry of the mechanical parts. In order to investigate the effect of temperature variation and phase transformation on the dimensional change and stress distribution, thermo-elastic–plastic constitutive equation coupled with the mechanical strain, thermal strain, phase transformation strain, and transformation induced plasticity is described in detail. Using the constitutive equation introduced, a ﬁnite element program was developed and used to predict distributions of the temperature, volume fraction of each phase transformed, and stress and dimensional change of the cylindrical specimen, shaft with key groove, and cam-lobe made of carbon steel. It was found out that numerically obtained values such as temperature history and stress distribution were in good agreement with the data available in the literature for the cylindrical carbon steel specimen. The developed program can be used for better understanding of mechanics involved with the quenching process.},

For this, different analytical and numerical criteria are usedto demonstrate the similarity between them, in particular the distance of Hausdorff. The results show that these equations are similar fromthe mathematical point of view and the parameters of the Gompertz equation are explicitly related to those of the Avrami equation. It isconcluded that Modified Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami and Montijano-Bergues-Bory-Gompertz equations can be used to describe thegrowth kinetics of unperturbed tumors.},
